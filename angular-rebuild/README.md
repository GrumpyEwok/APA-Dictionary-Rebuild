# Plan of Attack:

I'm going to be doing a rebuild of the American Psychological Association's online dictionary.  It's freely available to the public, and subsequently there's not a lot of CRUD functionality to play with -- however, I can always add it in/switch to an Authorized view mode. The main components are going to be:

A Header (which may contain hard-coded <a> elements),

A Side Nav (with List Items)

A Main Display Area:  An Array of Letters (displayed), a line stating the number of entrees in the dictionary (which I could make dynamic in respect to the CRUD functionality I can add later) a "Word of the Day" feature/hero.

A Footer.
